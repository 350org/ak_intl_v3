We already have another user account with the email <b>{{ target }}</b>. Maybe 
you already took an action with that email?
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to consolidate your two accounts, we'll send an email to 
<b>{{ target }}</b> to confirm it's your email. Once you click the link in the 
email, we'll change your email address from <b>{{ actionkit_user.email }}</b>
to <b>{{ target }}</b>.
